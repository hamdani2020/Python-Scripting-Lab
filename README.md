# Basic Python Scripting Lab

## Introduction

The **Basic Python Scripting Lab** introduces students to essential Python modules (`os`, `requests`, `shutil`) and fundamental file handling operations. By the end of this lab, students will be able to perform tasks such as downloading files, organizing directories, modifying file contents, and appending timestamps.

## Lab Objectives

By completing this lab, learners will be able to:
- Perform basic file handling in Python.
- Use Pythonâ€™s `requests` module to download content.
- Use the `os` module to create directories and define file paths.

## Task Overview

This lab consists of the following tasks:

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**: Set up an environment using `python3 -m venv <environment_name>` and install the required `requests` library.
2. **Create a Custom Directory**: Use the `os` module to create a directory named `<firstname_lastname>` (e.g., `john_doe`).
3. **Download a File**: Use the `requests` module to download a file named `change_me.txt` from a specified GitHub repository.
4. **File Management**: Save the downloaded file in your custom directory, renaming it to `<firstname_lastname>.txt`.
5. **Modify File Content**: Replace the content of the downloaded file with user input and append the current date and time.
6. **Verify the Change**: Display the updated content of the file to verify modifications.
